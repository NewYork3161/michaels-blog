         <p class="para-post-page">The last week has seen me modify my web page once again and spend another four to six hours working on it. The results of my efforts have been quite satisfactory and I am very pleased with them.</p>

         <p class="para-post-page"> This afternoon, I added more features to my website and looked into ways to upload it on a server. This will allow me to access my website from anywhere and make sure my posts don't disappear when the website is turned off.</p>

         <p class="para-post-page"> I have been making efforts to advertise my website, but unfortunately, I haven't been able to find an affordable way to do it yet. However, my friend and I find it both amusing and interesting, so I am hoping that I will eventually come across a free or cheap alternative that I can utilize as soon as possible.</p>
